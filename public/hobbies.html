        My absolute favorite thing to do on my free time is to travel and learn about the different cultures of the world. I pride myself in being curious and adventurous. The photos above are taken in Mexico and Chicago.

        I emjoy getting as much exercise as I can. I've been playing soccer since I was 3 years old, and I cherish the valuable leadership skills that it taught me, both working as a team and working on myself.

        Since moving to Chicago, I have loved exploring the city and the food within it! I have been lucky enough to explore the city through my taste buds and can give a killer reccomendation.
